            <h2>Instructions
            <br>
            =========
            </h2>
            <h3>Navigating the Menu</h3>
            <p>The page you are on right now is the menu. There is a grid of numbers in the middle. Those are the levels in the game. The levels that you can play are tan. The levels that you did not unlock yet are grey. When you click on a level you will immediately begin playing it. Good luck!
            <br><br>At the of the page, right under <i>The Ice Of Time</i>, you will see what size the game board will be. You can navigate between the sizes by clicking the green arrows.
            <br><br>At the bottom of the menu are 4 buttons. Clicking on Music and Sound will toggle them on and off. Clicking credits will display a credits screen. You obviously know what clicking Rules does.
            </p>
            <h3>Playing the game: Controls</h3>
            <p>You have gotten into a game. At the start of each level a message from Master Hesby will pop up. Click on it or press any key to hide it. To control the player, the only buttons you need to use are WASD or the Arrow Keys. If you want to restart a level, click R. To bring up the in game menu, press space.</p>
            <h3>The Player</h3>
            <p>The player is the red box. It is the only object in the game that can be controlled by you. When it moves, it will keep sliding until it runs into something. It can not be stopped until it collides with an object</p>
            <h3>The Objective</h3>
            <p>The objective of the game is to get to the shiny yellow star. If the player hits it the level will be completed! You do not need to stop on it, only slide over.</p>
            <h3>Obstacles</h3>
            <h4>Ice</h4>
            <p>Ice blocks are light blue. They are walls in this game. They can not be pushed, moved, destroyed, changed etc.</p>
            <h4>Boxes</h4>
            <p>Boxes are grey blocks. They can be pushed but only in certain scenarios. If you run into them they will not move. You must be next to a grey block and move into it to push. Once it starts moving it will slide until it hits something. If it is blocked from moving by a grey block it will move that one.</p>
            <h4>Switches and Doors</h4>
            <p>Switches are small green squares lying on the ground. Doors are orange blocks. When something is directly on top of a switch, it will open a door. As soon as that thing moves off the door will cloe again. Boxes can be moved on top of switches to keep them held down.</p>
            <h4>Time Travel Machines</h4>
            <p>Here is when things get confusing. The moment the player block goes into the time travel machine, he will go back in time. This means the entire level will reset, all boxes will be where they were previously, all doors will be closed/opened. You will see a ghost of the player moving around. This ghost follows the exact path that the player previously took to get to the teleporter. From the moment the level started to the moment the player went into the teleporter, every action will be repeated by the ghost. You will still be on the teleporter and you will still be able to move around. You can run into the ghost. Use this to your advantage throughought the game. However! This is important.
            <b>If the path of the ghost is changed, if he is blocked from getting to the teleporter, you will hear a pop and he will stop moving act as a box(grey block).</b><br><br>All of this is confusing but can be learned in time through playing the game.</p>
            <h3>In Game Menu</h3>
            <p>The in game menu can be brought up by clicking space and closed by clicking space. There are three buttons. The left one will restart the game, the center one will bring you back to the menu, and the one on the right will take you to the next level.</p>
